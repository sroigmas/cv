## üë® About me

Senior Software Engineer in Java / Kotlin with big experience in developing microservices
and REST APIs with Spring Boot and technologies such as Kafka, AWS, Docker and
Kubernetes. I have also worked as Tech Lead as well as doing management tasks in
several projects.

In my day to day, I like to use a modern tech stack and learn new technologies. Also, I
care about code quality and I bet for the use of best practices and code analysis tools. I
consider important to apply hexagonal architecture and SOLID as well as a good testing
using ATDD or BDD.

- Showing **demos** of the achieved results to the rest of the company.
