**Engineer Lead** @ [Wefox](https://www.wefox.com/en-de) _(Apr 2022 - Jul 2022)_ <br>
_Remote from Valencia (Spain)_ <br>

My role was a mix of tech leadership and management.

On the development side, I planned the extension of our data model (aligning with the architect and product) to support new markets and products.

Also, I was actively participating in the Java Chapter (we followed the Spotify model) by sharing knowledge with the other teams in the company (like integrating CodeClimate with Github for the code quality analysis or adding code analysis tools locally to the projects to detect bugs, potential issues and security issues).

On the leadership and management side I had many responsabilities:
- Attending leadership meetings (for leads and managers) to support and manage any requirements across the company (like improving our observability strategy).
- Leading an initiative to integrate CodeClimate with Github in all the teams in the company.
- Defining the priorities and the roadmap in my team (along with product) to speed up our business and aligning with other teams for any dependencies.
- Performing 1:1s/follow-up meetings every two weeks with the members of my team to detect any personal issues or any issues related to the project as well as helping them to improve and grow up professionally within the company.
- Doing the performance reviews of the members of my team to measure their performance and professional progress (by using the OKR framework).

<ins>Main technologies and tools used:</ins> <br>
Java 11, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Web, REST, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Data JPA, Kafka, Kafka Streams, Kafka Schema Registry, Postgres, Liquibase, OpenAPI, Stoplight, Lombok, MapStruct, JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers, BDD and performance testing, Gherkin, Cucumber, Serenity, REST Assured, Scala, Gatling, AWS (ECR, EKS, ParameterStore, S3, DMS), Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Git/Github, Github Actions, Nexus, Sonar, SonarQube, CodeClimate, Kibana, Checkstyle, PMD, Scrum, DDD, Hexagonal architecture and SOLID.

**Senior Java Developer** @ [Wefox](https://www.wefox.com/en-de) _(Oct 2021 - Apr 2022)_ <br>
_Remote from Valencia (Spain)_ <br>

I worked in the claims domain developing microservices part of an event-driven architecture with Kafka. We deployed our microservices on the cloud using AWS, Docker and Kubernetes. For the REST API design, we were using an API first approach using Stoplight and OpenAPI.

As part of my tasks I was migrating the business logic, previously in Salesforce, and adapting the architecture and the data model to onboard in a new market (Italy).

I also worked on the migration from Java 11 to Java 17, updating our CI/CD pipelines to use the new version and improving the code to work with Java records and remove the Lombok dependency.

Besides, I took part in the company's selection process, reviewing the candidate's challenge and making the technical interview.

<ins>Main technologies and tools used:</ins> <br>
Java 11, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Web, REST, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Data JPA, Kafka, Kafka Streams, Kafka Schema Registry, Postgres, Liquibase, OpenAPI, Stoplight, Lombok, MapStruct, JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers, BDD and performance testing, Gherkin, Cucumber, Serenity, REST Assured, Scala, Gatling, AWS (ECR, EKS, ParameterStore, S3, DMS), Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Git/Github, Github Actions, Nexus, Sonar, SonarQube, CodeClimate, Kibana, Checkstyle, PMD, Scrum, DDD, Hexagonal architecture and SOLID.

**Senior Software Engineer** @ [Openbank](https://www.openbank.es/) _(Jun 2021 - Oct 2021)_ <br>
_Valencia (Spain)_ <br>

I worked on the Corebanking project developing microservices of retail banking (consumer/personal banking). Concretely, we worked on the migration of the accounts and customers functionality to a new architecture of lambdas and microservices in AWS and using SQS communication.

<ins>Main technologies and tools used:</ins> <br>
Java 11, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Web, REST, Spring Data JPA, Oracle, Postgres, Flyway, ActiveMQ, Swagger/OpenAPI 3, Lombok, JUnit, Mockito, AWS (EC2, ECS, S3, SQS y Lambda), Docker, Wildfly, Temenos T24/Transact, Temenos IRIS, Apache Camel, Maven, Git/Bitbucket, Bamboo, Harness, Nexus, Splunk, Sonar, SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD and Findbugs.

**Programmer analyst / Technical lead** @ [GFT](https://www.gft.com/es/es) _(Mar 2020 - Jun 2021)_ <br>
_Valencia (Spain)_ <br>

I worked on a project for Deutsche Bank about trade finance and automatic de-risking between multiple investors. It was composed of more than 100 people, grouped in several teams, so we were using the large-scale agile methodology known as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) based on Scrum. My tasks consisted on the analysis and development of small microservices, development of component and E2E tests, occasional front-end development in React and production deployment and support. Besides I was holding the role of technical lead in my team, constantly interacting with our client and the project architects, taking part in the decision making, elaborating the technical design of the tasks as well as providing support in the technical part of the development.

When it was required, we applied pair programming to ensure the code quality. Besides, we made use of code quality tools (SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs, SonarLint and Veracode) and code review tools (Bitbucket).

Related to the testing, we used a ATDD/BDD approach, refining and defining the scenarios at functional level previosly to the development and making use of tools such as Gherkin, Cucumber and Serenity.

<ins>Main technologies and tools used:</ins> <br>
Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Web, REST, Spring Cloud (Feign and Hystrix), Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring JMS, ActiveMQ, Liquibase, Lombok, React, JUnit, Mockito, Gherkin, Cucumber, Serenity, Selenium, Maven, Git / BitBucket, TeamCity, Sonar, Veracode, Artifactory, uDeploy, Openshift, Geneos, SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs and SonarLint.
